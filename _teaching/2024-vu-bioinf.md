A series of three lectures for genetics BSc students for the phylogenetic section of a bioinformatics course in 2024.
The first lecture covers the basics of molecular evolution - what do we use phylogenetics for and where does the phylogenetic signal come from?
The second lecture concerns the statistical modelling of molecular evolution using continuous time Markov chains in maximum likelihood and Bayesian settings.
The third lecture describes extensions to phylogenetic methods - modelling amongst-site rate heterogeneity, molecular clocks, coalescent, etc.
