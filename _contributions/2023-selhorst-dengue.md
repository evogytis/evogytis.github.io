### Background

The origin and spread of dengue virus (DENV) circulating in Africa remain poorly characterized, with African sequences representing <1% of global sequence data.

### Methods

Whole genome sequencing was performed on serum samples (n=29) from an undifferentiated fever study in 2016 in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and from febrile travelers returning from Africa. 
The evolutionary history of the newly acquired African DENV-1 (n=1) and Cosmopolitan genotype DENV-2 (n=18) genomes, was reconstructed using a phylogeographic, time-scaled Bayesian analysis on a curated DENV panel including all known African sequences.


### Results

A minimum of 10 and 8 introductions could be identified into Africa for respectively DENV-1 and Cosmopolitan DENV-2, almost all originating from Asia. 
Three introductions were previously unknown. 
The currently circulating virus comprises mainly recently introduced clades and one long-established, African clade. 
Robust geographical clustering suggests limited spread of DENV after each introduction. 
Our data identified the DRC as the source of the 2018 Angolan DENV-2 epidemic, and similarly, the 2013 Angolan DENV-1 outbreak as the origin of our DRC study.


### Conclusion

Active genomic surveillance of DENV in Africa at the portals of entry might help early outbreak response, and limit sero- and genotype spread and human disease burden.
