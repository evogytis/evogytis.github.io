Here we release draft genome sequences of Zika virus (ZIKV) that were sequenced from PCR-positive diagnostic specimens collected by the United States Virgin Islands Department of Health (USVI DoH) as part of their ongoing response to the ZIKV outbreak.
We will use these sequences to conduct a genomic epidemiological study of ZIKV transmission in the USVI.
We are releasing these genomes in the hope that they are useful for those individuals involved in the public health response to ZIKV and to other groups working to understand Zika virus transmission and evolution.
